It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain.

In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared.

Let's perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can see a well-defined 3.5 × 3 × 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. It's covered with light bluish smooth mucus. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure to the tumor?\nPatient: Yes, I feel slight pain when you press on it.\nDoctor: Alright. Your tongue's mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and I don't detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation.

No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.\nPatient: So, what does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.\nPatient: Alright, so what will the surgery involve?\nDoctor: During the surgery, we'll make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, we'll find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. We'll carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.\nPatient: I see. What happens after the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgery, we'll fix the tissue sample with 10% formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

He described initial discomfort in the front of his knee, which progressed to pain the following day. The patient denied any preceding injury or specific event that could have triggered the symptoms. He also reported a temporary relief from pain after receiving an intra-articular injection of xylocaine, but noted a subsequent catching sensation in the knee.\nO: Physical examination revealed no swelling at the knee joint. Orthopedic tests including the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, varus/valgus instability, and McMurray test were negative. However, the patient exhibited severely restricted range of motion due to pain. Radiographic imaging showed no abnormalities, but MRI revealed a soft tissue mass near the knee joint with ill-defined borders and specific signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images. Blood tests were within normal limits.\nA: The primary diagnosis is a soft tissue mass near the knee joint, likely benign given the MRI characteristics and histological findings post-surgery. Differential diagnoses such as lipoma, lipoma arborescens, and pigmented villonodular synovitis were considered but ruled out based on surgical and histological evaluation.\nP: The patient underwent successful surgical removal of the mass via knee arthroscopy, which involved resection of a large fat mass from the anterior surface of the proximal-lateral PF joint. Post-operative recovery has shown significant improvement in symptoms with resolution of pain and mobility issues. The patient is advised to follow up regularly and report any recurrence of symptoms. Further management includes physical therapy to restore full range of motion and strength, and monitoring for any signs of recurrence or complications."}

You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.

You underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: After the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin (100 mg per day), TiGraylo (90 mg once every 12 h), and enoxaparin sodium (0.4 mL once every 12 h subcutaneously) for 3 days. Your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin (102 g/L), prolonged prothrombin time (13.4 s), and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment for this?\nDoctor: We tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition.

{"id": "", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you've come in today for an evaluation of worsening dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having more trouble breathing lately, and I've developed a cough. I also feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen.\nDoctor: I understand. Based on your medical history, you have limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Do you have any history of atopy or food allergies?\nPatient: No, I don't. I do use an albuterol inhaler as needed though.\nDoctor: That's helpful to know. Your PAH was diagnosed seven years ago, with a reported pulmonary artery pressure of 80/39 mmHg, mean PA pressure of 56 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and cardiac output by thermodilution of 3.17 L/min. Your pulmonary function tests at that time showed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.06 L (75% predicted) and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 19.61 mL/min/mm Hg (66% predicted). You were treated with dual therapy, tadalafil and macitentan, for PAH and were able to wean from oxygen supplementation. How has this treatment been working for you?\nPatient: It worked well for a while, but recently I've been feeling worse.\nDoctor: I see. Your ILD was considered mild, and you didn't require supplemental oxygen at rest or with exertion. You were treated with mycophenolate mofetil for a year after your initial diagnosis. However, you discontinued this medication about 6 years ago due to fear of reactivating remote Lyme infection after reading about chronic Lyme disease on the internet. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your medical records indicate that you had been stable on your regimen of tadalafil and macitentan until 3 months ago when you began to experience rapidly progressive dyspnea and new onset hypoxemia. A recent right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed that your PAH had worsened, with a mean PA pressure of 72 mmHg and a new drop in cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m2). As a result, you were started on subcutaneous treprostinil. How have you been feeling since starting this new medication?\nPatient: I'm still not feeling great. My breathing has been getting worse, and the cough hasn't gone away.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to closely monitor your symptoms and possibly adjust your medications. It's important to keep up with your regular appointments and let us know if there are any changes in your condition. In the meantime, continue using your albuterol inhaler as needed.\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to keep you updated and come in for regular check-ups.\nDoctor: Thank you.

You were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: During the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. We also performed a CT scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. Have you experienced any other symptoms?\nPatient: No, not really. Just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.\nDoctor: Okay. We performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under Bethesda category III. We did a repeat FNA three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is Bethesda category II. \nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial FNA, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: The right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. Upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. We also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.\nPatient: Oh, no.\nDoctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).\nPatient: What should I do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition.

Have you had any infections or procedures?\nPatient: I had a human papilloma virus infection, and I received 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccination about 7 years ago. I also had an intrauterine device inserted 4 years ago, was diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3, had a cervical conization procedure 3.5 years ago, and underwent laparoscopic tubal sterilization about 1 year and 4 months ago.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. During your initial physical examination, we noticed abdominal stiffness and tenderness upon palpation. We also conducted a urine pregnancy test, and it came back positive.

Your lab data revealed a serum β-hCG level of 15795 million IU/mL, a white blood cell count of 12300/μL, and a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, clinical signs, imaging, and high level of serum β-hCG, we highly suspect an ectopic pregnancy. We will admit you for a surgical intervention tomorrow. However, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as vomiting, sudden syncope, or hypotension, you need to let us know immediately.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. Thank you.\n[14 hours after admission]\nPatient's Family Member: Doctor, my sister just experienced vomiting, sudden syncope, and her blood pressure dropped to 79/42 mm Hg.

{"id": "", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?\nDoctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date.

Upon referral, it was reported that you have been a heavy smoker for 20 years, smoking about 20 cigarettes per day. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And it seems that you also frequently consume alcohol, though not to the point of abuse. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, I do drink quite often but never really overdo it.\nDoctor: In your medical history, it shows that you have arterial hypertension and are currently under treatment with beta blockers. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking them for a while now.\nDoctor: Good to know. Your hematological and biochemical tests did not show any significant abnormalities. Now, let's discuss your physical examination. We performed a full head and neck examination, along with a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The typical ear, nose, and throat examination didn't reveal any abnormal findings, and neck palpation was negative.\nPatient: Okay, that's good news.\nDoctor: However, the fiberoptic laryngoscopy did reveal a lesion affecting both vocal cords and the anterior commissure. Your vocal cord mobility also appeared impaired. Based on these findings, we decided to conduct a cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous gadolinium and scheduled you for direct microlaryngoscopy and a biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia.\nPatient: I see, so what did the imaging show?\nDoctor: The imaging confirmed the laryngeal lesion, but it also indicated a second lesion about 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, between the first and second tracheal ring. The intermediate tissue appeared grossly normal. No signs of enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted, and laryngeal cartilages showed no abnormal findings.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: The histopathological examination after the biopsy confirmed that you have squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is a glottic carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and is strongly correlated with the thyroid cartilage. The lesion has infiltrated the left and the first tertile of the right vocal cord. No subglottic extension was noted.

Can you please provide some background information about the pregnancy and birth?\nMother: Yes, I had a difficult pregnancy. The baby was born at 23 weeks of gestation by C-section due to preeclampsia and premature membrane rupture. My husband and I are first cousins, and I've had two abortions in the past.\nDoctor: I see. What was the birth weight of your baby?\nMother: He was very small, only 680 grams at birth.\nDoctor: That is quite small indeed. I understand that the baby had to be intubated and given surfactant treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Is that correct?\nMother: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: The baby has bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias, which are likely associated with the severe prematurity. Since the gender assessment at birth was made as male, the baby received a male name and identity card. Can you tell me about your maternal history during pregnancy?\nMother: I was treated with progesterone for one month between the 16th and 20th gestational weeks and also with salicylic acid throughout the pregnancy. There was no evidence of virilisation, such as acne, hirsutism, deep voice, or clitoral enlargement.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination of the baby, we found complete labioscrotal fusion and a single urogenital meatus, consistent with Prader stage-3. The gonads were not palpable, a chorda was present, and the phallus measured 2x1 cm on the dorsal and 1.6x1 cm on the ventral side. The baby is currently still in the neonatal intensive care unit and requires mechanical respiratory support. On postnatal day 30, we checked the baby's hormone levels. The 17-hydroxy progesterone (17OHP) was 41 ng/mL, which is slightly above the normal limits of 35.5 ng/mL. The DHEA sulphate (DHEASO4) was 1500 µg/dL, much higher than the normal range of 123-882 µg/dL. The testosterone level was also elevated, at 2.94 ng/mL, compared to the normal limits of 0.05-0.16 ng/mL. The FSH level was 1.3 IU/L.\nMother: Oh, I see. What does all this mean for my baby?\nDoctor: These hormonal imbalances may be related to the baby's genital appearance and the presence of a uterus. We will need to continue monitoring the baby closely and provide appropriate treatment as needed. It's important to keep a close eye on the baby's health and development, and we will need to schedule regular follow-up appointments with the pediatric endocrinology team.\nMother: Thank you, doctor.

On admission, we initially treated you with IV fluids and started you on oral Prednisolone at 25 mg daily. Our Rheumatology team suspected a flare-up of your known rheumatoid arthritis. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was ruled out on a venous ultrasound-Doppler. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\nDoctor: We also conducted extensive investigations to diagnose the aetiology of the AKI. You were started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic, Tazobactam + Piperacillin, due to a positive urine dip and microscopy. The urine culture later grew Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus sp., and based on microbiologist advice, we initiated Daptomycin at 4 mg/Kg. We discontinued Prednisolone the day before. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, within fifty minutes of receiving the first dose of Daptomycin, you suffered from two tonic-clonic seizures which were five minutes apart. These lasted approximately two minutes each and both terminated spontaneously. How are you feeling now?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm feeling better now, thanks.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We conducted a further neurological examination and found no focal deficit. You also experienced a single, further, generalised seizure 2 hours later for a few minutes, but no others were observed afterward. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: On that day, your mean arterial pressure was 130 mmHg, and your oxygen saturations ranged between 94 and 97%. We also recorded your elevated BP for the preceding week. Your haemoglobin was 105g/l, urea was 13.8 mmol/L, creatinine was 228 micromol/L, eGFR by MDRD was 19ml/min, and C-reactive protein was 14 i.u.

Have you experienced any locking in the joint or felt a palpable mass?\nPatient: No, there's no locking or any mass that I can feel.\nDoctor: And do you have any other significant past history that I should be aware of?\nPatient: No, I don't have any other significant past history.\nDoctor: I see that you haven't received any conservative treatments or plain x-radiography. Based on an MRI of your right knee, there's an intra-articular lesion located around the posterior cruciate ligament. The lesion shows iso-intensity or lower intensity compared to surrounding muscle in T1 weighted MRIs, and high signal intensity in T2 weighted MRIs (Fig. ). The preoperative differential diagnoses could be synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or malignant soft tissue tumour.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We're planning to perform an arthroscopy operation to remove the lesion and obtain a biopsy to test for malignant soft tissue tumour. If it's positive for malignancy, additional wide extra-articular resection would be needed, and artificial joints were prepared.\nPatient: Alright, what happened during the arthroscopy?\nDoctor: During the arthroscopy of your right knee, we found synovial hyperplasia inflammation and the mass in front of the right posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). We excised the lesion and performed a partial synovectomy.\nPatient: What were the findings of the biopsy?\nDoctor: Macroscopically, the right knee mass was a piece of grey-red tissue measuring 2.5 cm by 2 cm by 1 cm in size. The antibodies, clones, dilutions, pretreatment conditions, and sources are listed in Table . On microscopic examination (Fig. ), the tumour consisted of a bland fibroblastic proliferation arranged in irregular fasciitis with tissue-culture-like appearance. The stroma varied from focally myxoid with microcyst formation to collagenous. Extravasated erythrocytes and small lymphocytes were present throughout the lesion. No areas of necrosis or atypical mitosis were seen.\nPatient: What about the immunohistochemistry results?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the cells were positive in patches for SMA and negative for S100, desmin, CK(AE1/AE3), and nuclear (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, what does all this mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it appears that the lesion is not malignant, which is good news.

Central 30-2 perimetry shows an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.\nA: The primary diagnosis is ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy, evidenced by reduced visual acuity, abnormal VEP results, and MRI findings. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of optic neuropathy or central nervous system lesions, but these are less likely given the clinical context and imaging results.\nP: The management plan includes discontinuing ethambutol and consulting with the patient's primary care physician to discuss alternative treatments for the mycobacterial infection. Further ophthalmologic follow-up is recommended to monitor the progression or improvement of visual symptoms. Patient education regarding the signs of worsening vision and the importance of regular eye examinations will be provided.

Based on these findings, we have initiated Vasopressor support and an unfractionated heparin drip, and you have been admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.\nPatient: I see. What about the imaging tests?\nDoctor: Imaging tests showed a low-probability VQ scan for pulmonary embolism and severe diffuse myocardial hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20–25% without pericardial effusion. Your CT abdomen showed generalized lymphadenopathy and mild hepatosplenomegaly. However, your chest X-ray was negative for any acute pathology on admission.\nPatient: Did you run any tests for autoimmune diseases?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed a detailed rheumatologic workup, which was unremarkable. This included tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA, antiproteinase 3, antimyeloperoxidase, and C3 and C4 levels.\nPatient: What's the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a right heart catheterization, which demonstrated elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure.

What's the next step?\nDoctor: In July 2008, you underwent brachytherapy using 106Ru. You received 100 Gy at the apex, with a dose rate of 79.09 cGy/hr, and a total rate at the sclera of 531.1 Gy, with a dose rate of 420.1 cGy/hr.\nPatient: Okay, I remember that treatment.

UBM showed a local scleral extension of the tumor under the conjunctival layer, 0.88 mm thick. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20.\nPatient: So, what was the next step?\nDoctor: The patient underwent a radical block excision of the sclera, ciliary melanoma, and adjacent iris tissue. This was done by performing a peripheral iridectomy through the opening of the sclera, combined with a corneal tectonic graft, 8.50 mm large. We used 16 single stitches to close the wound.\nPatient: I remember that surgery.

Have you identified any triggers or noticed any changes in your health during this time?\nPatient: No, I haven't identified any triggers and I've been otherwise healthy.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your description and the clinical features, it seems that you, along with some other patients, have erythematous papules that form plaques arranged in a reticular pattern, which is more prominent peripherally. Other patients also had vesicles and minimal erosions, with lesions symmetrically distributed, mainly on the trunk. Have you noticed any other affected areas on your body?\nPatient: Hmm, I think the lateral and posterior aspects of my neck are also affected.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for the information.

We managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.\nPatient: Yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.\nDoctor: However, your PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 mEq/dl. This was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. We noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was >20 mEq/dl. Your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Well, with uncontrolled hypertension and the presence of chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, we decided to conduct a workup for hyperaldosteronism. Your serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity were within normal limits, so we proceeded with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.\nPatient: What did the test show?\nDoctor: The test revealed elevations of ACTH (319 pg/ml) and cortisol (131.5 μg/dl), consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and a condition called SAME, which is caused by an ectopic nonsuppressible source of ACTH. Furthermore, you've experienced significant weight loss of 28 pounds after your SCLC diagnosis and profound muscle wasting.\nPatient: That's a lot to take in. What's next for me?\nDoctor: We'll be working closely with you to create a personalized treatment plan to address both your SCLC and the metabolic issues.

Can you tell me about your antenatal visits and any symptoms you've experienced during your pregnancy?\nPatient: Yes, I attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. They documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. I had occasional painful fetal kicks, but I was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.\nDoctor: It's good that you had regular visits. When did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?\nPatient: Hmm, about three days before I got admitted to your service, I noticed the reduced movements, so I consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.\nDoctor: I see. When you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. There was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. Fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldn't perceive fetal heart tones. Also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. Your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. We requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. However, it didn't diagnose an intra-abdominal location.\nPatient: That's really sad. So, what did you do next?\nDoctor: We started cervical ripening with 50µg of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. After 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. So, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nPatient: What did you find during the operation?\nDoctor: The intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. The uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. We decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.\nPatient: What treatment did I receive after the operation?\nDoctor: Postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infection. Additionally, you received 50mg of methotrexate every other day for 4 doses, along with 5mg of folinic acid each day following the methotrexate treatment.\nPatient: When can I expect to be discharged?\nDoctor: You were discharged on day 8 postoperation to continue your recovery at home.\nPatient: Thank you for all the information and the care I received during this difficult time.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Gastric lavage was performed as an initial treatment.\nA: The primary diagnosis is ethylene glycol poisoning, evidenced by the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine, metabolic acidosis, and an elevated anion gap. The differential diagnosis would consider other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but clinical presentation and lab results strongly point to ethylene glycol toxicity.\nP: The patient has been started on oral ethanol therapy, dosed at 2.5 ml/kg of 40% ethanol via a nasogastric tube, to competitively inhibit the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Hemodialysis is also initiated to correct metabolic acidosis and remove ethylene glycol from the bloodstream. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes, and acid-base balance will be necessary. Further education on the dangers of toxic substance ingestion will be provided to prevent future incidents."}

However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\nPatient: What can be done about it?\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia.

We performed a renal biopsy, which confirmed that it's renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer.\nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible.\nDoctor: I understand your concern. We have a treatment plan to address this issue. We placed a hook wire in the tumor with the help of an interventional radiologist and CT guidance.\nPatient: What's the purpose of that?\nDoctor: The hook wire helps us localize the tumor during surgery. It's a technique we use for nonpalpable breast lesions to facilitate intraoperative localization. We will perform a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor.\nPatient: How does the surgery work?\nDoctor: You will be placed in a modified left lateral decubitus position, and we will establish pneumoperitoneum. Trocars will be placed to access your abdomen. We will mobilize your bowel medially and develop the plane between the anterior Gerota's fascia and the posterior mesocolon.\nPatient: Okay, and then?\nDoctor: Your kidney will be mobilized within Gerota's fascia. We will locate the hook wire and clamp the renal artery with a bulldog. The renal capsule will be resected using scissors under warm ischemia, which will take about 25 minutes.\nPatient: How will you stop the bleeding?\nDoctor: Hemostasis will be achieved using a combination of cautery, hemostatic agents, and suturing. We will use sutures preloaded with clips to secure a suture line, allowing for lateral compression perpendicular to the renal capsule.\nPatient: What will the results be like?\nDoctor: The histopathology report confirmed clear-cell renal carcinoma with negative surgical margins.

I've also had unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under my jaw.\nDoctor: Hmm, have you noticed any lumps in your neck area?\nPatient: Yes, I've felt some non-tender lumps on both sides of my neck.\nDoctor: It seems you have bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III. Now, I understand you've had biopsies done before by an otolaryngologist. What were the results?\nPatient: They didn't find any cancer, but they saw some reactive inflammatory changes.\nDoctor: Okay. We also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. However, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: A multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.\nPatient: I remember that. I also developed some red spots on my extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.\nDoctor: Yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR titer of 1:512. We then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed spirochetes. You were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.\nPatient: How am I doing after the treatment?\nDoctor: After receiving treatment, your tongue lesion is healing well, but there is still a persistent anterior tongue cleft.

How have you been feeling since your treatments?\nPatient: I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The combination of treatments led to a complete response, and there were no residual cancer areas or lymph node involvement documented on the surgical piece.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Let's discuss your recent check-up. In 2018, during your regular oncological follow-up, a subpleural pulmonary nodule was detected in the lower lobe of your left lung. It measured about 15x10 mm. Considering your clinical history, general conditions, and the localization of the lesion, a surgical resection of the lung was performed.

Your urinary protein was 5.1 g/g-creatinine, and dysmorphic erythrocytes were found in your urine. \nPatient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. What does it all mean?\nDoctor: A renal biopsy was performed on day 45, which showed fibrin thrombi within capillary loops, mesangiolysis, and double contour of the basement membrane of glomeruli. Immunofluorescence indicated weak deposition of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in mesangio-capillary regions. An electron micrograph showed diffuse endothelial swelling with obliteration of capillary lumina. The pathology was diagnosed as renal-limited TMA. Other causes of nephrotic syndrome, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, were ruled out.\nPatient: So, was it the ramucirumab that caused all this?\nDoctor: Yes, it appears that ramucirumab is the likely cause of your TMA. Since the biopsy, the ramucirumab treatment has been discontinued.\nPatient: What should I expect now?\nDoctor: By 6 weeks (day 69) after your last ramucirumab injection, your thrombocytopenia should be resolved, and your platelet count should return to normal levels.

These lesions are reported to be tuberculomas based on the imaging findings and MRI spectroscopy findings.\nPatient: Oh! What does that mean?\nDoctor: Tuberculomas are masses that can develop in the brain due to a tuberculosis infection. To further investigate, we performed a CT thorax scan with administration of intravenous contrast. The scan showed consolidation with cavitation in your left upper lobe and fibrosing mediastinitis. There was also soft tissue extension along the left hilum, narrowing the left pulmonary vessels and left bronchus. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were seen as well.\nPatient: That sounds serious. What's the next step?\nDoctor: Given the brain lesions and lung findings, we suspected tuberculosis. So, we performed a CT-guided biopsy of the thick-walled cavity. The histopathological and microbiological findings showed features of cryptococcus pneumonia.\nPatient: What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: We've started you on antifungal therapy to treat the cryptococcus pneumonia.

Can you describe the pain and discomfort you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, the pain in my right groin area has been bothering me for a few weeks now. It gets worse whenever I move, and I also feel some discomfort in my right thigh.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We conducted laboratory tests, and your white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were normal. We also performed ultrasound and computed tomography examinations, which indicated a vermiform appendix in an inguinal hernia sac. However, there were no remarkable findings of inflammation in the appendix (Fig. a, b).\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what's the diagnosis then?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with an Amyand's hernia (AH) without appendicitis. We attempted a reduction of the hernia under ultrasound, but it was unsuccessful. Therefore, we planned a combined totally extraperitoneal (TEP) mesh repair and laparoscopic appendectomy after laparoscopic reduction.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. What does that procedure involve?\nDoctor: First, you will be placed in a supine position and undergo general anesthesia by tracheal intubation. We will first perform a laparoscopic transabdominal approach after establishing pneumoperitoneum. A 5-mm direct umbilical trocar and a needle forceps (Endo Relief™) will be introduced into the upper right abdominal quadrant to inspect the hernia canal for the absence of appendicitis and reduce the appendix laparoscopically.\nPatient: Alright. What happens after that?\nDoctor: During the inspection, we found a 3 × 2 cm right external inguinal hernia defect with the appendix, but no other intra-abdominal pathology was identified. We will pull the vermiform appendix out and place it in the abdominal cavity without tearing it. After that, we will reduce the hernia sac into the abdomen via the laparoscopic TEP approach.\nPatient: Okay, and then what?\nDoctor: You will be placed in a 30° Trendelenburg position. We will lateralize the rectus muscle and insert a Covidien Balloon Dissector preperitoneally from the umbilical incision of the skin to the symphysis pubis. The balloon will be insufflated to open the extraperitoneal area. We will then introduce additional trocars: a 12-mm trocar in the initial umbilical incision of the skin and anterior right fascia of the rectus, and a 5-mm trocar at the symphysis.\nPatient: I understand.

{"id": "", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of jaundice in your skin and sclera, along with epigastric pain for the past two weeks. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The yellowing and pain have been bothering me a lot.\nDoctor: I understand. We've conducted several examinations to determine the cause, including enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scans, a chest X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, tumor markers, liver and renal function tests, and coagulation function tests. Let me go over the results with you.\nPatient: Okay, please do.\nDoctor: The CT scans revealed a low-density mass of 4.0 cm in diameter located in the uncinate process of your pancreas. Additionally, your intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are obviously dilated, and your pancreatic duct is slightly dilated as well. The non-contrast CT scan showed calcification within the mass, and the contrast CT showed that the enhancement of the tumor is similar to the surrounding normal pancreatic parenchyma. Here's a figure for you to see (Fig.).\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there's a growth in your pancreas that could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, let's go over your laboratory data. Your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels are within the normal ranges. However, your AFP level is elevated at 71.5 ng/mL, while the normal range is less than 8.1 ng/mL.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, your carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is within the normal range at 2.0 ng/mL, but your carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is significantly elevated at 437.2 U/mL, with the normal range being 0-37 U/mL. Your aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are also elevated, at 51 U/L and 151 U/L, respectively.\nPatient: Wow, that's quite high.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. Furthermore, your total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) levels are also elevated, at 281.2 μmol/L and 212.6 μmol/L, respectively. These results, along with the imaging findings, led us to suspect an incorrect diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm before the operation.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that we initially suspected a specific type of pancreatic tumor, but further examinations and test results may require us to revise our diagnosis. Our team will continue to investigate and determine the appropriate course of action.\nPatient: Alright. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will need to perform additional tests and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Once we have a definitive diagnosis, we can then discuss treatment options and develop a care plan tailored to your specific needs.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

However, you did experience some complications, including constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia.\nPatient: Yeah, that was a tough time. What came next?\nDoctor: To consolidate your remission, you underwent myeloablative conditioning, which included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). This was followed by a stem cell transplant to help rebuild your immune system and fight off any remaining cancer cells.\nPatient: I remember that. It was quite an intense treatment.\nDoctor: Yes, it can be. But the good news is that you achieved a complete molecular remission, which is a great outcome.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been suffering from severe epigastric pain and nausea for the past two days.\nDoctor: I see. Based on your symptoms and your history, I would like to run some laboratory tests to see if there might be any issue with your pancreas. The findings may help us determine if you have pancreatitis or not.\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: Your laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis, so we decided to proceed with a computed tomography (CT) examination. The CT scan showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space as well as in the anterior, posterior, and lateroconal fascia. There were no signs of chronic pancreatitis or vascular complications, but you did have two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis in the following months.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: In September 2009, you presented with vague epigastric pain lasting several weeks. Your serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, but your cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated. We performed a magnetic resonance (MR) study, which demonstrated moderate chronic pancreatitis of the tail with atrophy and irregular bordering of the Wirsung's duct. No other abnormalities were found, but further examinations revealed a Helicobacter pylori gastritis.\nPatient: Hmm, that's concerning.\nDoctor: In February 2012, you presented again to the gastroenterologist with epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Your laboratory findings were not suspect for acute pancreatitis. However, we performed a contrast-enhanced CT scan to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other potential causes of your pain.\nPatient: And what did the scan find?\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail, consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels. We needed to differentiate between a vascular malformation and a hypervascular pancreatic tumor, such as an islet cell tumor or a hypervascular metastasis.\nPatient: How did you do that?\nDoctor: We performed a contrast-enhanced MR study which showed a focal area of heterogeneous contrast enhancement without an apparent nodular component. The subsequent angiography revealed two large feeding arteries in the early arterial phase, followed by a racemose vascular network, an early transient dense parenchyma stain in the early portal phase, and early wash-out of the lesion in the portal phase.\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation.\nPatient: What does that mean for me, and what do I need to do now?\nDoctor: It means that there is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in your pancreas. We will need to monitor your condition closely and discuss potential treatment options with you.

Instead, we started you on two courses of chemotherapy with a single dose of carboplatin 450mg intravenously at three-week intervals.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. But I couldn't do the third course because my liver function tests were not good.\nDoctor: That's correct. Unfortunately, the ascites has been progressive, which has led to maternal respiratory distress and fetal growth restriction and oligohydroamnios.

However, we didn't attempt filter retrieval at that time due to the large amount of clot within the filter.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what happened next?\nDoctor: After 5 weeks of Warfarin therapy, you were scheduled for a retrieval, which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs. We introduced a 14-F sheath, an SOS catheter, a Bentson wire, and an EN Snare to create a loop. We attempted the single loop-snare technique several times, but it kept slipping around the filter legs.\nPatient: That sounds difficult. What did you do then?\nDoctor: To stabilize the loop, we formed a second loop using the same technique around the filter tip. With two loops around the filter tip, we were finally able to successfully pull the filter away from the wall and into the 14F sheath.\nPatient: That's a relief! What's the next step now?\nDoctor: A follow-up venography will be performed to ensure that the filter has been successfully removed and to monitor your condition. You'll need to continue taking your anticoagulation medication and follow up with us regularly to prevent any future complications.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

She reports some improvement post-surgical thrombectomy but continues to experience pain and swelling.\nO: The patient underwent a surgical thrombectomy with a suprarenal IVC filter placement, which later dislodged and tilted, complicating her condition. Follow-up CT revealed the filter's displacement towards the right IVC wall, with legs piercing into the left renal vein. Despite oral anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin, re-thrombosis occurred, leading to catheter-directed thrombolysis and stenting of the common iliac veins and the IVC. Recent interventions include successful filter retrieval using a dual loop-snare technique. Current medications include Warfarin.\nA: The primary diagnosis is postpartum DVT with complications including filter displacement and re-thrombosis. Differential diagnoses could include chronic venous insufficiency or post-thrombotic syndrome. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic following successful filter retrieval, though vigilant monitoring for further complications is necessary.\nP: The patient will continue on Warfarin therapy and undergo follow-up venography to ensure complete removal of the IVC filter and assess venous status.

We performed a bronchial artery angiography, which confirmed the expansion and meandering of the bronchial arteries and the growth of the reticular artery from the diaphragm arteries (Fig. E). We attempted two arterial embolizations and also plugged an endobronchial Watanabe spigot into your right inferior lobar bronchus, but unfortunately, they failed to stop the haemoptysis.\nPatient: What's the next step then?\nDoctor: We had to perform a thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy to remove the affected area. The excised surgical specimen presented a small hypoaerated, atrophied, and occluded right inferior lobe. The bronchus was underdeveloped and irregular throughout its running (Fig. F).\nPatient: I see.

Can you please describe how it feels and when these symptoms started to develop?\nPatient: Yeah, the pain is mostly on the ulnar side of my wrist, and it started about a year after the fracture. The appearance of my wrist seems a bit deformed too.\nDoctor: I see. Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a Salter–Harris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.\nPatient: So, what's the plan to fix this?\nDoctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenskiöld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth.\nPatient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist?\nDoctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail Fixator™ will be used for lengthening.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good.

The function of your left levator palpebrae muscle has been eliminated to a slight elevation using the frontal muscle. There's also a metal plate anchored to the inferior wall of your orbit. How have you been managing with these changes?\nPatient: It's been tough, but I'm getting used to it.\nDoctor: I also observed that during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction, your left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were excised. Intraorally, your left maxilla has been excised from the midline and the rectus abdominis muscle flap was sutured directly to your soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around your left upper lip is scarred, without the oral vestibule. Have you experienced any discomfort or difficulty with this?\nPatient: Yes, sometimes it's uncomfortable and the flap margin has moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.\nDoctor: I see that the 70 × 50 mm flap is sagging from its weight and is in contact with your mandibular molars, which reduces the volume of your oral cavity unless you wear dentures. Your maxilla has been removed from the midline to the maxillary tuberosity, while your mandible has been removed from the anterior border of the ramus to the coronoid process. Has this caused any issues with your dentures?\nPatient: Yeah, it's been a bit difficult to adjust to them.\nDoctor: During the reconstruction, the dead space was eliminated by placing the abdominal rectus muscle from the anterior cranial base to the oral cavity (Fig.). Have you noticed any expiratory leakage or food reflux?\nPatient: No, I haven't experienced any leakage or food reflux.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Prior to performing surgery, there was no tumor recurrence or metastasis detected. Have you been keeping up with your follow-up appointments to monitor your condition?\nPatient: Yes, I have been attending all my follow-up appointments.\nDoctor: Great. I also see that you have a mouth opening of 43 mm. Are you experiencing any difficulties with this mouth opening size?\nPatient: Not really, I can manage with it.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on our conversation and my examination, we will work on improving your denture retention and stability. We may need to make adjustments to your current dentures or consider other options to ensure your comfort and proper function.

Do you remember experiencing any pain or discomfort during that time?\nPatient: Hmm, I think I did have some discomfort, but I don't remember the specifics.\nDoctor: Your urine culture revealed various organisms isolated at 10-100,000 CFU/ml. The urinalysis showed a small amount of blood, a moderate presence of leukocytes, and a trace of protein. At the end of 2020, you underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it, along with satellite lesions. These findings likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain. Have you been experiencing any new symptoms or discomfort recently?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having some lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain, along with hematuria and constipation.\nDoctor: I see. The MRI also showed chronic pancreatitis with a dilated duct and stone. You were referred to the gastroenterology department for this issue. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your pancreas?\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed anything new or concerning.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. A bone scan and chest CT were performed, and fortunately, no significant abnormality or metastasis was found. After a couple of days, you presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days, along with hematuria and constipation with fullness. You denied any history of fever or vomiting, and there were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Your vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1℃. How has your pain been since then?\nPatient: It's been a bit better, but I still have some discomfort.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing all of this information. It's important that we monitor your symptoms and follow up with the gastroenterology department for your pancreatitis.

Have you experienced any CSF rhinorrhea, otorrhea, or other symptoms related to your condition?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those issues.\nDoctor: That's good to know. To further investigate your seizures, we've done a seizure workup which included a video EEG. It confirmed that your paresthesias and phantosmia are caused by right temporal lobe epilepsy. We also performed computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which demonstrated a right temporal lobe encephalocele.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: In addition to the TLE, the MRI showed increased edema and flair signal within your right mesial temporal lobe.

During the procedure, we found discolored fluid in the knee and palpable loculations in the suprapatellar pouch. We also found grass in the knee and at the fracture site. \nPatient: That must be why my knee was so infected.\nDoctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. \nPatient: What is the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We used a reamed irrigator aspirator (RIA) during the procedure, which will help with recovery. Going forward, we will closely monitor your healing process and address any complications that may arise. It's important that you continue to follow the nonweightbearing status on your injured leg and follow up with us regularly.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and come in for regular check-ups.\nDoctor: Great, that's very important for your recovery.

He mentions initial treatment included wound irrigation and administration of IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin, followed by splint application. Post-surgery, he experienced progressive knee discomfort starting about four weeks after the incident, characterized by severe pain, swelling, redness, and restricted movement.\nO: Initial assessments revealed a 1 cm wound with foreign material (grass) and no neurovascular deficits. Postoperative treatment included intraoperative irrigation, debridement, and placement of a suprapatellar intramedullary nail (IMN). Follow-up examinations showed a large knee effusion, erythema, and limited knee range-of-motion. Aspiration of the knee yielded cloudy yellow fluid with a white cell count over 100,000 and 96% neutrophils; cultures grew gram-negative rods. Surgical findings included discolored fluid in the knee, palpable loculations, and grass at the fracture site. A synovectomy and extended debridement were performed, resulting in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect over the anteromedial tibial fracture site.\nA: The primary diagnosis is postoperative infection of the knee and tibia fracture site, likely exacerbated by foreign material (grass) contamination. Differential diagnoses could include non-infectious inflammatory response; however, the presence of high white cell counts and positive cultures confirm infection. The prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and proper wound healing.\nP: The patient underwent removal of hardware, I&D of the knee, fracture site, and intramedullary canal, followed by synovectomy and extensive debridement. He was instructed to maintain nonweightbearing status on the affected leg and adhere to a strict follow-up schedule. Ongoing monitoring of the infection and healing process is essential, with adjustments to the treatment plan as necessary based on recovery progress and any arising complications. Regular check-ups are crucial for timely intervention and recovery optimization."}

Let me perform a clinical examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can feel a pulsatile mass with a continuous machinery murmur in the outer upper quadrant of your left breast. We'll need to do a Color Doppler imaging to get a clearer picture of the lump. \nPatient: Okay, sure.\nDoctor: Based on the Color Doppler imaging, we found an anechoic lump measuring 45 × 26 × 33 mm, fed by an afferent artery. It shows a yin-yang appearance and a biphasic \"to-and-fro\" pattern. There's also a fistula situated 3-mm proximal to the anechoic lump, connecting the afferent artery and a concomitant vein. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with breast PA-AVF. Don't worry, we'll take good care of you. We've consulted with a multidisciplinary team and determined that the lesion poses a risk of rupture. It's recommended that the lesion be excised and ligated under local anesthesia as soon as possible.\nPatient: I see.

The incision will be at the 1 o'clock position, 7 cm from the nipple, and it'll be concealed to prevent any cosmetic defect. We'll then ligate the proximal and distal artery and vein of the PA-AVF and excise it.\nPatient: Is the surgery complicated?\nDoctor: No, the entire operation is quite simple and time-efficient.

Lab results showed white blood cell count of 1.57 K/mcL (normal: 4.5-11 K/mcL), hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL (normal: 13.8-17.2 g/dL for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dL for women), hematocrit 30.2% (normal: 41-50% for men, 36-44% for women), and platelet count 119 K/mcL (normal: 150-450 K/mcL). Endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of lymph nodes showed tumor cells positive for S100 and HMB45, consistent with metastatic melanoma. Bone marrow biopsy indicated B-cell lymphoma with extensive infiltration.\nA: The primary diagnosis is metastatic melanoma with secondary diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of cancer or metastatic diseases. The prognosis is guarded due to the advanced stage of cancer and presence of multiple malignancies.\nP: The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and admitted for further pulmonary evaluation. A multidisciplinary team involving oncology, hematology, and pulmonology will be consulted for comprehensive cancer management. Treatment options including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy will be discussed with the patient. Supportive care, including nutritional support and pain management, will be provided. Regular follow-ups and monitoring of treatment response and side effects will be scheduled. The patient will be educated about the nature of his illnesses, treatment options, and supportive care measures to ensure understanding and compliance."}

He admits to a period of medication nonadherence at age 54, which was followed by severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain.\nO: The patient's initial symptoms and subsequent test results confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome of pituitary etiology. Postoperative persistence of hypercortisolism was noted. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large collection of stool and gas in the mesentery with multiple diverticulae. Surgery identified a 1.5 × 3 cm perforation of the sigmoid colon, managed by distal sigmoidectomy and creation of an end colostomy. Current medication includes cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly, with recent lab tests indicating eucortisolemia.\nA: The primary diagnosis is Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary corticotroph adenoma, complicated by postoperative persistent hypercortisolism and a significant episode of sigmoid colon perforation secondary to stercoral ulcer. Differential diagnosis initially included other causes of Cushing's syndrome.\nP: Continue cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly to manage Cushing's syndrome. Emphasize the importance of medication adherence to prevent recurrence of hypercortisolism and associated complications.

Then, 3 weeks later, we did a TES for VSD repair without robotic assistance. During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position with your arms along your body, under general anesthesia with a single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nPatient: What else did you do during the surgery?\nDoctor: We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft to connect your right common FA with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. We also inserted SVC and IVC cannulae via your internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using the Seldinger technique.\nPatient: And then what happened?\nDoctor: When we started the CPB, your arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg. So, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation by inserting an additional 10Fr FA cannula directly into your left common FA.

In the ICU, we immediately intubated him with an endotracheal tube that is 3.5 mm in diameter and 11 cm in length. We also started him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and clarithromycin, for severe pneumonia and sepsis. Additionally, he was given phenytoin and morphine.\nDoctor: We also noticed a firm, smooth, immobile left submandibular mass, extending to the neck levels II-V. We performed a CT scan, which revealed a 27 mm × 47 mm × 42 mm parapharyngeal/paravertebral cystic mass that is obliterating the oropharyngeal airway. Acute left LST was also discovered and confirmed via an MRI.\nParent: Oh, that sounds serious. What are the next steps in his treatment?\nDoctor: We have started him on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) at a dosage of 1 mg/kg–1. Additionally, we performed an ultrasound-guided aspiration, which revealed pus. We drained 20 ml of fluid and flushed the cavity with 40 mg of gentamicin.\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your son's condition and adjust his treatment as needed.

And what about the obstruction caused by the hematoma?\nDoctor: We observed obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma for a few weeks. However, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nPatient: That's a relief.

So what did you find during the procedure?\nDoctor: Although the body of your appendix looked intact, as well as your ileum and cecum, the histopathological examination revealed PAA in the tip of the resected appendix. Because of this, we have planned a radical operation for the residual tumor of PAA in your pelvic cavity.\nPatient: What does that operation involve?\nDoctor: It involves a whole mass resection and ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection. In the first operation, we speculate that we removed the body of your appendix but left most of the mass and the tip of the appendix. So in the second operation, we will remove the mass that was derived from the tip of your appendix.\nPatient: Will you need to remove any other organs?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, yes.

Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yeah, I was so angry and confused.\nDoctor: It seems you experienced an episode of psychosis with a fixation on a recently read fictitious character, leading to suicidal ideation. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: I don't know why, but I became obsessed with this character and started thinking about ending my life.\nDoctor: Your sister provided more details about your past trauma. You lived with an alcohol-dependent father and were a victim of racial abuse and physical assault. This has led to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a protectionist savior complex. Does that sound accurate?\nPatient: Yeah, that's true. I've been through a lot.\nDoctor: When you were in the ER, you refused to provide blood and urine samples for toxicology screening. Is there a reason why?\nPatient: I just didn't want to do it at that time. I was too agitated.\nDoctor: I understand.

Can you tell me about any symptoms you're experiencing?\nPatient: Good morning, Doctor. I've been experiencing some chest discomfort and shortness of breath lately.\nDoctor: I understand. When you were 71, you had a successful endovascular treatment for your occlusive right common iliac artery. At that time, we performed transthoracic echocardiography for screening, which revealed a dilated aortic root with a width of 49 mm. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I remember.\nDoctor: We also did an electrocardiogram-gated cardiac computed tomography (EG-CT) that revealed two sinus of Valsalva aneurysms (SVAs) in both the left and right coronary sinuses, with no obstruction to surrounding cardiac structures. The sizes of the SVAs were 27.2 mm and 33.1 mm for the left and right sides, respectively. Due to their relatively small size, we decided to observe them carefully for 5 years. \nPatient: Right, I've been coming in for regular check-ups.\nDoctor: I appreciate your diligence. In your recent follow-up EG-CT, we noticed that the sizes of the SVAs had grown to 34.5 mm and 35.7 mm, respectively. The transthoracic echocardiography also showed moderate aortic regurgitation. The SVA in the left coronary sinus has grown between the pulmonary artery and the left atrium, bulging out on the anterior surface of the heart. The SVA in the right coronary sinus has also grown, pressing the right ventricular outflow tract.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We concluded that both SVAs are extracardiac, meaning they're expanding on the surface of the heart. This type has a relatively high risk of rupture, which could be life-threatening. Given this situation, I recommend that you undergo surgery for SVA removal. \nPatient: I see. What does the surgery involve?\nDoctor: The operation will be performed via median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. After inducing cardioplegic arrest, we will transect the ascending aorta just above the sinotubular junction. Upon inspecting the interior of the aortic root, we will remove the SVAs and repair the affected areas. \nPatient: I understand.

Can you tell me more about when this jaundice occurs and how it affects you?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've had episodes of jaundice during each of my pregnancies. I'm fourth gravida, with one live issue after a fourth-degree consanguineous marriage. The jaundice usually starts in the late second trimester and subsides slowly over two to three months after delivery. Between pregnancies, I have minimal or no jaundice.\nDoctor: I see. And during these years, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain?\nPatient: No, doctor. I've been mostly asymptomatic, except for the jaundice. I don't have a history of fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain. I'm also a non-alcoholic and a non-smoker.\nDoctor: That's helpful information. Do you have any history of blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, chronic drug intake, or exposure to occupational hazards?\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of those things.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing this information. Now, regarding your bilirubin levels, your pre-pregnancy levels were in the range of 3.0-4.0 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal value of 0.1-1.2 mg/dL. During the second trimester of each pregnancy, these levels would rise to about 11.0-12.0 mg/dL. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It appears that you typically have isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with conjugated bilirubin levels rising to as high as 8.0 to 10.0 mg/dL, while unconjugated bilirubin remains in the range of 2.0-3.0 mg/dL. Your liver function test has always been normal, with serum transaminase levels less than 20 IU/L and serum bile acid levels and proteins within the normal range. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Given the absence of pruritus and normal bile acid levels and serum transaminases, we can exclude the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no associated gestational hypertension or proteinuria. Your hemogram is unremarkable, and your peripheral smear has never shown any evidence of hemolysis. Therefore, thrombotic microangiopathies have also been ruled out.

I've been having some issues lately and wanted to discuss them with you.\nDoctor: I see. Were there any issues with the transplant, like human leukocyte antigen mismatches?\nPatient: Yes, there were 2 HLA mismatches. I'm an ex-smoker and was on hemodialysis for four years before the transplant. There were no records of blood transfusions or previous kidney transplantations.\nDoctor: What was the cold ischemia time during your transplantation?\nPatient: It was 17 hours.\nDoctor: Alright. What immunosuppressive regimen were you on for induction and maintenance?\nPatient: For induction, I was given Basiliximab. My maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day, mycophenolate, and prednisone.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any issues with your renal function since the transplant?\nPatient: I developed delayed graft function and needed hemodialysis for a week.

Your family has a history of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Have you ever used alcohol or tobacco?\nPatient: No, I have never used alcohol or tobacco.\nDoctor: Alright. I see that your elevated alkaline phosphatase level was first noticed in 2013, along with some vague abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed hepatic steatosis. Your viral serologies for hepatitis were negative. A gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. Can you tell me more about the pain you were experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, the abdominal pain came and went for about two years. It was quite vague and hard to pinpoint.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also see that you had some vague chest pain and dyspnea, which prompted an echocardiogram in February 2015. The echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease, but a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: In July 2015, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed suspicious cirrhosis, possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary because of your rising alkaline phosphatase levels without other explainable etiologies, as well as your appetite suppression and the vague abdominal pains you were experiencing. At that time, your weight was 207 lbs (93.89 kg), and you were advised to diet and exercise. \nPatient: Yes, I remember that. I tried my best to follow the advice.\nDoctor: After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially the abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy in September 2015. The liver biopsy showed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. The chronic and patchy inflammation is representative of granulomatous hepatitis, despite not having elevated transaminases. \nPatient: Oh, I see. So that's what was causing the pain and inflammation.\nDoctor: Yes, it appears so. Now, it's important that we continue to monitor your alkaline phosphatase levels and other symptoms.

Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any pain, discomfort, or medical problems lately?\nPatient: No, I don't feel any pain or discomfort, and I don't have any medical problems that I know of.\nDoctor: Alright, during the history taking, your response seemed a bit late. Has anyone mentioned concerns about that before?\nPatient: No, not really.\nDoctor: Okay, from your history, I see that you've had a successful repair of cleft lip and palate. Now, let's discuss your extra-oral examination. We noticed facial asymmetry on the left side, flattening of the nasal bridge, increased intercanthal distance (35 centimeters) which is also known as orbital hypertelorism, and frontal bossing (54 centimeters). We also observed multiple skin lesions on your arms, and right foot and palmar/plantar pits. Were you aware of these issues?\nPatient: Yeah, I noticed those, but didn't know what they meant.\nDoctor: In the intra-oral examination, we found multiple carious teeth, painless hard swelling in the left side of your mandible, and mild pain on percussion in all the left mandibular posterior teeth. We performed an orthopantomogram (OPG) which showed bilateral radiolucent lesions associated with a partially erupted mandibular second molar teeth. The left mandibular lesion extended up to the ramus of the mandible. Additionally, you have a horizontally impacted maxillary right second molar and congenitally missing second premolars and third molars. \nPatient: Oh, I didn't realize all that was going on in my mouth.\nDoctor: We decided to do a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) for a detailed radiological assessment of the mandibular lesions. Accidentally, the CBCT revealed another large lesion associated with the impacted right maxillary second molar, extending up to the right maxillary sinus. The lower left lesion was severely expanded in all directions (buccolingual, anteroposterior, and superoinferior), and we noticed perforations in the buccal and lingual borders of the mandible. \nPatient: That sounds serious. What does it mean?\nDoctor: It's definitely concerning, and we'll need to address these issues before moving forward with orthodontic treatment. Lastly, a skull X-ray revealed calcification of the falx cerebri on the posteroanterior view. We'll need to monitor this closely and may need to consult with additional specialists to determine the best course of action.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will develop a treatment plan to address the multiple carious teeth and the lesions in your mouth. In the meantime, it's important to maintain good oral hygiene and attend regular dental checkups. We'll also discuss your case with the orthodontist to ensure a coordinated approach to your orthodontic treatment once the necessary dental work is completed.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

{"id": "", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hi there, I see that you've presented to our emergency department with complaints of nausea and vomiting for four days. I'm sorry to hear that.\nPatient: Yes, it's been really difficult to deal with.\nDoctor: I understand you were diagnosed with right-sided, multicentric, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast 10 years ago. You were Stage 1A, estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Is that correct?\nPatient: Hmm, yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And you had a right mastectomy, with sentinel lymph nodes sampled during surgery, which were negative for metastases. You were also treated with adjuvant anastrozole for five years, and yearly mammograms have been negative for recurrence. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I see that one year prior to this presentation, you were evaluated at our hospital for similar complaints of nausea and vomiting. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis on admission revealed a mass-like thickening of the gastric antrum and distension of the proximal stomach. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: An upper endoscopy (EGD) was performed, which revealed esophagitis and gastric stenosis. This was dilated using a through-the-scope controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon, without fluoroscopic guidance. Biopsy of the gastric stenosis revealed gastric mucosa of antral type with minimal chronic inactive gastritis. No morphologic evidence of a Helicobacter pylori infection was detected. Did your symptoms of nausea and vomiting improve following balloon dilation?\nPatient: Yes, they did improve after that.\nDoctor: Good to hear. You were discharged on a daily proton pump inhibitor. Now, you underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) 12 weeks later. Gastric stenosis was found at the pylorus and duodenal bulb, which was dilated again with a CRE balloon to a maximum dilation of 13.5 mm. Do you recall this?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: The EUS also showed diffuse wall thickening of the antrum of the stomach, with the gastric wall measuring up to 11 mm in thickness. Thickening within the deep mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria was noted. EUS-guided biopsies were taken. Unfortunately, the biopsies revealed invasive poorly differentiated metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible news.\nDoctor: I understand this is difficult to hear.

{"id": "", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, I understand that you were diagnosed with infectious cervical tuberculosis on C1 about a year ago, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And you underwent posterior C1-2 screw-plate fixation surgery at a hospital in India. How did you feel after the surgery?\nPatient: Initially, my neck pain improved, but over the last nine months, my swallowing function has gradually worsened.\nDoctor: I see. You also experienced loss of reduction and progressive dysphagia, along with severe weight loss, right?\nPatient: Yes, exactly. I was referred to your hospital because of these issues.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information. I also see in your medical history that you have hypertension and mild diabetes mellitus, with an HbA1c of 6.2% NGSP. Have you been receiving antitubercular treatment since your diagnosis?\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking the prescribed medications from my local hospital.\nDoctor: Good to know. Now, let's discuss your current condition. Your height is 165 cm, and your weight is 52 kg, which gives you a BMI of 19. You've lost 25 kg over the past 7 months due to difficulty in swallowing. Are you currently using a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding?\nPatient: Yes, I am. It's been helping me get the nutrition I need.\nDoctor: That's important for your recovery. During your neurological examination, we found left dominant proximal arm muscle weakness with atrophy, dysesthesia in distal fingers, and hyperreflexia throughout with bilateral extensor plantar reflex. In your oral examination, we noticed left tongue atrophy and left tongue deviation, consistent with unilateral HNP. Your routine blood work showed a slightly elevated level of C reactive protein (CRP), but the other findings were normal. Does this sound accurate to you?\nPatient: Yes, that's what I've been told.\nDoctor: We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed no specific abnormality. However, the lateral cervical X-ray showed an O-C2 angle of 17-degree kyphosis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an erosive lesion at the dens and anterior arch of the atlas. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in that area?\nPatient: Yes, I have. It's been quite bothersome.\nDoctor: I can imagine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying lesion in the retropharyngeal space, which presented with heterogeneous signals on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Interestingly, a review of your previous imaging studies showed that the lesion has been gradually decreasing in size, despite the progression of O-C kyphosis. \nPatient: Oh, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: So, your main problems right now are severe dysphagia and subsequent malnutrition, as well as neck pain. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, it's important to continue using the NG tube for feeding and taking your antitubercular medications.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

I also have nasal obstruction and impaired nasal breathing for the past few months.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have any other medical history we should be aware of?\nPatient: No, the rest of my medical history is free.\nDoctor: Alright, let's start with a clinical examination. *Examines patient* I notice a polypoid lesion protruding from your right nostril, asymmetry of your face, and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We'll need to perform a computed tomography of your paranasal sinuses to get a clearer picture of what's going on. *Reviews CT results* The CT shows an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass that completely occupies your right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The lesion has caused extensive bone remodeling of your right maxillary sinus with complete absence of its anterior wall, erosion of the posterior wall, and entry of the lesion in the pterygopalatine fossa. There's also erosion of the ipsilateral lower and median orbital wall, and entry of the lesion in the orbital cavity. Despite its large size, the lesion seems to be well-defined without invasive characteristics.\nPatient: That sounds serious. What do the laboratory tests say?\nDoctor: Your routine laboratory tests are within the normal range. We also had a preoperative maxillofacial consultation, which excluded pathology of odontogenic origin.\nPatient: What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We'll have you undergo a biopsy under local anesthesia. *Performs biopsy* The findings show nonspecific inflammation. We'll need to perform open surgery under general anesthesia via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy.\nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\n*After surgery*\nDoctor: The surgery went well. The maxillary sinus mucosa was completely replaced by inflammatory tissue, which we were able to mobilize and dissect free from surrounding tissues within the orbit and pterygopalatine fossa. There was no macroscopic invasion of any neighboring structures. The histopathological examination revealed typical nasal polyposis with a mixed population of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages, and no evidence of fungal invasion.\nPatient: What's the postoperative treatment?\nDoctor: We'll start you on antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment for a short period. You'll also use local nasal mometasone furoate for 2 months after surgery, and we'll administer intensive saline solution irrigations.\nPatient: If I follow this treatment, will my symptoms improve?\nDoctor: Yes, following this treatment plan should help alleviate your symptoms.
